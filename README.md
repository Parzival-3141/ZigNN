# Hand-Rolled Neural Networks in Zig
Dead simple networks designed to emulate logic gates, using finite difference gradient descent.

It's interesting that ML is essentially just mathmatical modelling on steriods.

## Build
```sh
zig run single-neuron.zig
zig run basic-gates.zig
zig run complex-gates.zig --
```

Inspired ~heavily~ from [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGSba51aRYU).
I love how he presents topics in such an easy and understandable way, seemingly off the cuff.
